              I spent the first half of the summer of 2020 learning how to do web development with my friend Wes.
              Neither of us had much experience with software or web development, but we were keen to learn.
              We built the reader from the ground up, developing native PDF editing and visualization
              packages to give us full control over PDF rendering. We also included a number of smart features:
              smart search, and sentence similarity, to upgrade the PDF viewing experience. Over the summer,
              I worked on the full stack: the UX design, React frontend, Express backend, Mongo database connectivity, and 
              smart search features.

              For our Senior Design project, my friends and I created an underwater pollution collection platform we
              called Free Willy. The platform was designed to be as modular as possible to increase its use cases, with 
              collection filters that could be easily swapped out to collect different kinds of pollutants. I worked on
              the software systems of the robot, designing its communication packages, a tracking dashboard via AWS,
              a path planner, and control package. I also helped conceptualize and pitch the business case for our drone.
